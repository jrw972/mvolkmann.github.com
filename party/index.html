    <h1>Tami Volkmann's<br/>50th Birthday</h1>
    <p>
      I'm throwing a <b>SURPRISE</b> party
      for my lovely wife
      to celebrate her 50th birthday.
      It will be on Sunday, September 4 at 1 p.m.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party will be at Quail Ridge Park in Wentzville, Missouri.
      I know that's a long drive for some of you.
      I picked that location for several reasons.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tami likes that park.</li>
      <li>Tami likes dogs and there is a dog park inside the park.</li>
      <li>I was able to reserve a shelter (#6)
        that accomodates up to 100 people.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The shelter is very near the dog park.
      It is in the lower-left corner of the map below.
      The party can go on even if it rains because
      there is plenty of room in the shelter.
