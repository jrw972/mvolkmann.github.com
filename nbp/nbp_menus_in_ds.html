    <p>
      This page describes an approach for using NetBeans Platform menu items
      inside the Decision Space framework.
      There are at least two categories of menu items and toolbar buttons
      to consider, static and dynamic.
      Static menu items and toolbar buttons are always enabled and visible
      regardless of the active <code>TopComponent</code> or selected nodes.
      Dynamic menu items and toolbar buttons are sometimes
      disabled and/or invisible depending on which <code>TopComponent</code>
      is active or which nodes are selected.
    </p>

    <h3>Static Menu Items and Toolbar Buttons</h3>
    <p>
      Static menu items and toolbar buttons are typically created by
      using the Action Wizard to create an associated action.
      Details on this can be found <a href="nbp_actions.html#global">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Dynamic Menu Items and Toolbar Buttons</h3>
    <p>
      Dynamic (a.k.a. conditionally-enabled) menu items and toolbar buttons
      can also be created using the Action Wizard.
      However, after creating an action class, some modifications are required.
      By default, disabling actions cause the corresponding menu item
      and toolbar button to be disabled, not hidden.
      In order to hide them
      when a given <code>TopComponent</code> is deactivated
      and make them reappear
      when a given <code>TopComponent</code> is activated,
      see <a href="nbp_actions.html#conditional">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Comparison of NBP and DS Approaches</h3>
    <p>
      In the DS framework, populating and manipulating menus and toolbars
      is API-driven and occurs during application startup.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the NBP, the contents of menus and toolbars are typically defined
      in the <code>layer.xml</code> file of each module.
      Initial entries in these files are created by wizards
      such as the Action Wizard.
      Often these are modified by directly editing the XML.
      Modifying menus and toolbars from source code can also be done,
      but this is not common.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good understanding of the "system filesystem" is needed to
      effectively write code that modifies menus and toolbars at runtime.
      One reason to do this is to cause certain menu items and toolbar buttons
      to appear when a given <code>TopComponent</code> is active
      and disappear when it is inactive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The demo code in MathAction.java does this
      by using several helper classes developed by OCI.
      See <a href="nbp_actions.html#conditional">here</a>
      and the following classes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="nbp_DynamicAction.html">DynamicAction</a></li>
      <li><a href="nbp_FileSystemHelper.html">FileSystemHelper</a></li>
      <li><a href="nbp_MenuHelper.html">MenuHelper</a></li>
      <li><a href="nbp_ToolbarHelper.html">ToolbarHelper</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>DS Required Changes</h3>
    <p>
      DS menus are created using the classes
      <code>CAWMenuBar</code>, <code>CAWMenu</code>
      and <code>CAWMenuItem</code>.
      The following sections summarize the changes to these classes
      that are recommended and outstanding questions
      to get those classes to work within the NetBeans Platform.
      It is debatable whether doing this is a good idea.
      It may be better to remove all usage of these classes
      and use NBP concepts instead, rather than modifying these classes.
      While modifying the DS menu-related classes
      would reduce the amount of work required
      to port existing applications to run under the NBP,
      it retains the use of the DS API.
      In the NBP, much more of the GUI is defined using
      NetBeans wizards and editing <code>layer.xml</code> files.
    </p>

    <h3>CAWMenuBar</h3>
    <p>
      The following issues with <code>CAWMenuBar</code>
      need to be addressed.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>This class will no longer need to extend <code>JMenuBar</code>
        since the NBP manages menu bars.</li>
      <li>
        Determine if notifying menu bar listeners is really required.
        If so then modify listeners to implement the NBP
        <code><a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileChangeListener.html" target="_parent">FileChangeListener</a></code> interface
        and modify this class to register those listeners with an NBP
        <code><a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileObject.html" target="_parent">FileObject</a></code>
        that represents the menu bar
        using the <code>addFileChangeListenter</code> method.
        It is possible that menu bar listeners are
        only used for logging and testing.
      </li>
      <li>Modify the <code>add</code> and <code>remove</code> methods
        to delegate to methods in <code>MenuHelper</code>.</li>
      <li>
        Is it necessary for menu bars to have a set of "services"
        associated with them?  If so, change this class to implement the
        <code><a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util/org/openide/util/Lookup.Provider.html" target="_parent">Lookup.Provider</a></code>
        interface.  See <a href="nbp_lookup.html#ScopedLookup">here</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>addMenuBarAction</code>, <code>addStaticMenuBarAction</code>,
        <code>removeMenuBarAction</code> and
        <code>removeStaticMenuBarAction</code> methods need to be modified
        to work with NBP concepts.
        These will likely delegate to methods in
        <a href="nbp_MenuHelper.html"><code>MenuHelper</code></a> and
        <a href="nbp_ToolbarHelper.html"><code>ToolbarHelper</code></a>.
        Static menu bar actions are added to all instances of CAWMenuBar.
        Non-static menu bar actions are
        specific to a single instance of CAWMenuBar.
        Why would there be more than one menu bar?
        Does this only happen when there are
        multiple top-level windows (Frames)?
      </li>
      <li>The NBP doesn't support applications
        that have multiple top-level windows.
        This could be achieved by implementing
        a custom <code>WindowManager</code>, but it would be a lot of work.
        How does this impact future use of this class?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>CAWMenu</h3>
    <p>
      The following issues with <code>CAWMenu</code>
      need to be addressed.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>This class will no longer need to extend <code>JMenu</code>
        since the NBP manages menus.</li>
      <li>
        Determine if notifying menu listeners is really required.
        If so then modify listeners to implement the NBP
        <code><a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileChangeListener.html" target="_parent">FileChangeListener</a></code> interface
        and modify this class to register those listeners with an NBP
        <code><a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileObject.html" target="_parent">FileObject</a></code>
        that represents the menu
        using the <code>addFileChangeListenter</code> method.
        It is possible that menu listeners are
        only used for logging and testing.
      </li>
      <li>CAWMenu "captions" provide the menu name and the mnemonic key
        for opening the menu with a keystroke.
        Note that <code>JMenu</code> extends <code>AbstractButton</code>
        which has a <code>setMnemonic</code> method,
        so Swing <code>JMenu</code>s can have a mnemonic
        that causes them to be displayed.
        In the NBP, mnemonics/accelerators for menus and menu items
        can be specified by simply adding an '&amp;' character
        immediately before the mnemonic character
        in menu names and menu items in <code>layer.xml</code> files.
      <li>
        The <code>add..</code> and <code>remove...</code> methods
        need to be modified to work with NBP concepts.
        These will likely delegate to methods in
        <a href="nbp_MenuHelper.html"><code>MenuHelper</code></a> and
        <a href="nbp_ToolbarHelper.html"><code>ToolbarHelper</code></a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Is it necessary for menus to have a set of "services"
        associated with them?  If so, change this class to implement the
        <code><a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util/org/openide/util/Lookup.Provider.html" target="_parent">Lookup.Provider</a></code>
        interface.  See <a href="nbp_lookup.html#ScopedLookup">here</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Remove the use of <code>AWListAction</code> and
        <code>CAWListAction</code> since they don't seem to
        add anything beyond what NBP actions provide.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>CAWMenuItem</h3>
    <p>
      The following issues with <code>CAWMenuItem</code>
      need to be addressed.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>This class will no longer need to extend <code>JMenuItem</code>
        since the NBP manages menu items.</li>
      <li>This class should probably be eliminated.</li>
    </ol>
