    <p>
      Lookup objects are used to obtain references to other objects.
      There is a global Lookup and more narrowly scoped Lookups can be created.
      In order to use Lookup, <code>org-openide-util.jar</code> must be in the classpath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The global lookup automatically registers interfaces and classes that are listed
      in special text files within JAR files.
      These are located in the <code>META-INF/services</code> directory within the JARs.
      Their name is the full class name of an interface or class.
      Their content is a list of full class names that implement the interface or extend the class,
      each on a separate line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listeners can be registered to receive notification when the contents of a lookup changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The global Lookup can be obtained as follows:
    </p>
    <div class="code"><pre>
    Lookup globalLookup = Lookup.getDefault();</pre></div>
    
    <p>
      An object is obtained from a Lookup as follows:
    </p>
    <div class="code"><pre>
    SomeService service = someLookup.lookup(SomeService.class);</pre></div>
    
    <p>
      Custom classes can provide Lookup entries.
    </p>
