    <h2>Clojure Coding Guidelines</h2>
    
    <p>
      The primary motivation for most of the guidelines is code readability.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Use two spaces for indentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select meaningful names for functions and variables.
        Avoid acronyms that aren't commonly known.
        The only acceptable one letter names are for the following variables:
        i for an index and x/y/z for cartesian coordinates.
      </li>
      <li>
        The names of predicate functions (returning a boolean)
        should typically end with a question mark (?).
      </li>
      <li>
        Prefer rewriting code to make it clear over adding comments.
        If that cannot be achieved, add comments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Limit the number of functions invoked in a single line of code
        to five.
      </li>
      <li>
        Limit the nested depth of a function definition to four.
        In order to achieve this it may be necessary to
        introduce local variables to hold intermediate results
        or extract code into additional function definitions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only use anonymous functions for short function definitions
        that fit comfortably on a single line.
        Otherwise create a private, named function.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not write anonymous functions that have
        arguments that are anonymous functions.
    </ol>
