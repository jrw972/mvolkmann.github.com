    <p>
      Recently there has been a lot of conversation on Twitter about whether
      the React <code>setState</code> method is hard to learn.
      There are claims that it is better to learn Redux.
      This was triggered by a tweet from Eric Elliott
      which was further elaborated in
      <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/setstate-gate-abc10a9b2d82">this post</a>.
      Here is my take on the debate.
    </p>

    <h3>What does setState do?</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>setState</code> method is called on an instance of a component
      to update its state.
      After updating the state, the component and all components it renders
      are re-rendered.
      This is done asynchronously and the virtual DOM makes it very efficient.
    </p>

    <h3>How is setState called?</h3>
    <p>
      One way to call setState is <code>this.setState(<i>someObject</i>);</code>
      The properties in <code><i>someObject</i></code>
      replace properties in the current state.
      This is referred to as a shallow merge.
      Any properties in <code><i>someObject</i></code>
      that are not already in the state are added.
      Any properties in <code><i>someObject</i></code>
      that are already in the state are replaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way to call <code>setState</code> is
      <code>this.setState(<i>someFunction</i>);</code>
      The function is passed the current state as an object.
      It must return an object that will be shallow merged into
      the current state just like in the first approach.
    </p>

    <h3>How does one choose which way to call setState?</h3>
    <p>
      If any of the new state values need to be computed based on current state values, use the function approach.
      Otherwise use the object approach.  It is really that simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you want to set <code>name</code> to Bob
      and <code>score</code> to 5
      regardless of the current state, do this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      this.setState({name: 'Bob', score: 5});</pre>
    <p>
      If you want to uppercase the current name and increase the current score by one, do this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      this.setState(state => ({
        name: state.name.toUpperCase(),
        score: state.score + 1
      });</pre>

    <h3>When are the results available?</h3>
    <p>
      If you attempt to access a state property that you just changed
      by calling <code>setState</code> it will still have its old value.
      This is because <code>setState</code> performs the updates asynchronously.
      However, typically you want to use the new state values
      in the component <code>render</code> method.
      That works fine because <code>setState</code> triggers a re-render
      and it only does this after it has
      finished making the requested state changes.
    </p>

    <h3>Can setState be used as an alternative to Redux?</h3>
    <p>
      Definitely!  One of the main characteristics of Redux is that it holds
      all the application state in one place, called the "store".
      If you decide that the top component will hold all the application state
      then it can be viewed as the equivalent of the Redux store.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Redux, actions can be dispatched from anywhere.
      These typically result in updates to the store.
      So if Redux isn't being used, how would other components
      update the state of the top component?  It's easy!
      You just need some strategy to make the <code>setState</code> method
      of the top component available everywhere.
      Here's one approach:
    </p>
    <pre>
      React.setTopState = this.setState.bind(this);</pre>
    <p>
      Do this in the constructor of the top component.
      Now any component can call <code>React.setTopState</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>Is using setState simpler than using Redux?</h3>
    <p>
      Let's compile a list of the concepts that need to be learned
      in order to use Redux.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>action objects</li>
      <li>action type constants</li>
      <li>action creator functions</li>
      <li>dispatching actions</li>
      <li>reducers</li>
      <li>creating the store</li>
      <li>listening for store changes and re-rendering</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are the minimum concepts that must be understood.
      Typically additional layers are added such as
      react-redux, redux-saga, redux-thunk, and more.
      Each of these introduce more concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Really, how can anyone claim using Redux is simpler than
      the just using <code>setState</code>?
      Of course there are benefits in using Redux,
      especially for large applications.
      A big one is the ability to use the Redux Chrome plugin
      and "time travel debugging".
      However, for small to medium size applications
      trading that for the simplicity of using <code>setState</code>
      is often a good trade.
