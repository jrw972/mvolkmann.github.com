      <b>Jeff Brown</b>, also of OCI, contributed by testing the impact of
      zipping BOX. While it turned out to be slower doing this than sending
      unzipped BOX, it was quite valuable to confirm this. This test is
      described in more detail in the <a href="faq.html#zipToo">FAQ</a>.
      In addition to contributing this test, Jeff also identified several
      deficiencies in the BOX documentation.
      Jeff teaches numerous Java courses, develops courseware and
      provides Java consulting. 
      He's the author of
      <a href="http://www.jarspy.org" target="_parent">JarSpy</a>.
      Jeff can be contacted at
      <a href="mailto:brown_j@ociweb.com">brown_j@ociweb.com</a>.
      Thanks Jeff!
