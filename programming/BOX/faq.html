    <a name="license"/>
    <div class="question">What license governs the use of BOX?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Current the <a href="LICENSE.txt">GNU Lesser</a> license is used.
      The goal is to require improvements made to BOX to be published.
      If you find this license too restrictive, please let
      <a href="mailto:mark@ociweb.com">us</a> know
      and we'll consider changing it.
    </div>

    <a name="onlyjava"/>
    <div class="question">Is this only for Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Currently yes. However, for BOX to be truly successful we need
      implementations in a variety of programming languages.
      Maybe you can create an implemenation in another language
      and contribute it!
    </div>

    <a name="others"/>
    <div class="question">Hasn't someone already done this?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Yes and no. There have been other attempts to define more compact,
      binary representations of XML. The most notable is perhaps the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wbxml/" target="_parent">
      WAP Binary XML Content Format</a>.
      The problem with previous approaches is that they are too complex.
      BOX strives to be simple so that creating implementations in a
      wide variety of programming languages is practical.
    </div>

    <a name="size"/>
    <div class="question">How much smaller is it?"</div>
    <div class="answer">
      For really small XML documents, the difference may not be significant.
      In general, larger XML documents repeat text more.
      Element and attribute names are repeated,
      as are some of their text values.
      This leads to greater compression.
      The book "XML Bible" by Elliotte Rusty Harold comes with a CD that
      contains a file called 1998fullstatistics.xml.
      This contains statistics from the 1998 Major League Baseball season.
      The file has a size of 1042K (1,066,769 bytes).
      The BOX representation of this file is only 157K (160,672 bytes)
      which is 15% of the original size.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      For comparison, WinZip compresses it 69K (70,258 bytes).
      While this is smaller, it can't be processed as rapidly because it
      has to be unzipped and parsed with an XML parser.
    </div>

    <a name="speed"/>
    <div class="question">How much faster is it?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      In tests comparing shipping this document across a socket connection
      using both BOX encoding and XML text, BOX averaged 46% of the time
      required to ship XML text.
      The test parses the XML file into a DOM Document.
      It then measures the time required to encode the DOM Document into BOX,
      send it across the socket connection, and decode it back into a
      DOM Document on the other side. The same is done with DOM text.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      One caveat to this result is the impact of HotSpot.
      It introduces a "priming" effect that causes the first usage of BOX
      and the XML parser to take considerable longer than subsequent requests.
      BOX took 1203ms for the first run and
      averaged 205ms for 25 runs after that.
      XML took 1250ms for the first run and
      averaged 458ms for 25 runs after that.
    </div>

    <a name="zipToo"/>
    <div class="question">Would it be even faster to zip BOX?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Somewhat surprisingly, no! To test this, the sendBOX method in
      test.socket.Client was changed to use a ZipOutputStream on top of
      the BufferedOutputStream used to send BOX across a socket connection.
      The run method in test.socket.BOXServer was changed to use a
      ZipInputStream for reading the zipped BOX sent from the Client.
      This was not only slower than sending BOX, it was also slower than
      sending plain XML!
    </div>

    <a name="bestDocs"/>
    <div class="question">What kinds of XML documents does BOX handle best?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      BOX works best on XML documents that have lots of repeated text.
      This includes element names, text outside tags,
      attributes names and values, comments, namespace prefixes and URIs,
      and processing instruction targets and values.
    </div>

    <a name="stdXML"/>
    <div class="question">Shouldn't we just pass standard XML?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      XML is a great data format.
      Some of its greatest strengths are that it is human-readable
      and it can be processed by a large number of languages
      on a large number of platforms.
      While BOX is not really human-readable,
      it can be easily decoded into standard XML for human consumption.
      The advantages of BOX over XML are that it is more compact and
      it can be parsed into DOM objects or SAX events
      without using an XML parser,
      faster than an XML parser can parse standard XML.
      BOX may be ideal as a replacement for XML in SOAP messages.
      Wireless devices with limited space for software and
      limited processing speed would also benefit.
    </div>

    <a name="missingFeatures"/>
    <div class="question">Why doesn't BOX support feature XYZ?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Perhaps it's an oversight.
      Let us know what is missing and we'll consider adding it.
      It's also possible that the feature was intentionally omitted
      because adding it would increase the complexity of the implementation.
      Simplicity is deemed very important.
      We want to make it as easy as possible to develop
      BOX encoding and decoding implementations in a large number of languages.
      We don't want BOX to be limited to Java-to-Java applications.
      This is key to achieving widespread acceptance of BOX
      as an alternative to XML.
    </div>

    <a name="xerces"/>
    <div class="question">Why is Xerces required?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Units tests use classes in the "samples" directory that ships with Xerces
      in order to compare the canonical versions of XML documents.
      The source for the classes used has been copied into the BOX source tree
      and has been modified slightly.
      Those classes depend on classes in xerces.jar.
      This is the only dependency on Xerces.
      Otherwise an alternate parser such as Crimson could be used.
    </div>

    <a name="xalan"/>
    <div class="question">Why is Xalan required?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Xalan contains an implementation of JAXP.<br/>
      The following JAXP packages are used by BOX:
      <ul>
        <li>javax.xml.parsers</li>
        <li>javax.xml.transform</li>
        <li>javax.xml.transform.dom</li>
        <li>javax.xml.transform.sax</li>
        <li>javax.xml.transform.stream</li>
      </ul>
      JDK 1.4 includes xalan.jar (in rt.jar within the JRE directory)
      so it only needs to be downloaded and explicitly added to CLASSPATH
      when working with an earlier version of the JDK.
    </div>

    <a name="#attrBeforeElement"/>
    <div class="question">
      Why are attributes written out before
      the element in which they appear?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      When BOX is being decoded into SAX events,
      all the attributes of an element must be known before the
      <span class="code">ContentHandler</span>
      <span class="code">startElement</span> method can be called.
      If the attribute data appeared after the corresponding element data,
      we'd have to hold onto the element name and call
      <span class="code">startElement</span> when
      any node type other than an attribute was encountered.
      Coding this is cumbersome.
      I know because that's the way I originally wrote it! ;-)
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      In addition, since namespace declarations appear as attributes,
      the rationale explained in the next question applies.
    </div>

    <a name="#nsBeforeElement"/>
    <div class="question">
      Why are namespace declarations written out before
      the element in which they appear?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      Namespace declarations appear as attributes of an element.
      Namespaces defined in the start tag of an element
      are in effect for that element.
      This means that a namespace prefix defined as
      an attribute of an element can be used on that element.
      For example,
      <p><span class="code">
        &lt;<span class="highlight">foo</span>:myElement
        xmlns:<span class="highlight">foo</span>="http://www.ociweb.com/myNamespace">
      </span></p>
      Writing out information on namespace declarations
      before the element in which they are defined
      allows the element to be processed when it is encountered
      in a stream of BOX data instead of waiting until
      all its attributes are processed.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      In addition, when BOX is being decoded into SAX events,
      this makes it easy to call the
      <span class="code">ContentHandler</span>
      <span class="code">startPrefixMapping</span> method before the
      <span class="code">startElement</span> method.
