        There is currently a dependence on Xerces in order to
        compare two XML documents in their canonical form in unit tests.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since text lengths are currently specified using a two byte integer,
        there is a limit on the length of text values, albeit a very big limit.
      </li>
      <li>
        A worse problem is that if the length limit is exceeded it is possible
        that no exception will be throw and an invalid length will be written.
        FIX THIS!
