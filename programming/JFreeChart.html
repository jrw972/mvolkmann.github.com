    <h2>JFreeChart</h2>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      JFreeChart is a free, open source library for creating charts.
      Supported chart types include area, bar, box and whisker,
      bubble, candlestick, Gantt, high/low, histogram, line,
      multiple pie, pie, polar, ring, scatter,
      stacked area, stacked bar, stacked X/Y area,
      time series, wafer map, waterfall, wind,
      X/Y area, X/Y bar, X/Y line, X/Y step area and X/Y step.
      Output can be produced in many formats including
      Swing components, PNG, JPEG, PDF and SVG.
      A book on JFreeChart is available for $48.75 from
      <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/devguide.html">here</a>.
      JFreeChart can be downloaded from <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">here</a>.
      API documentation is
      <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/api/javadoc/">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>
      The data in this example represents the percentage of
      the runtime of a Java application that is
      not used for garbage collection, a.k.a. throughput.

    <h3>Alternatives</h3>
    <p>
      Google Charts is one alternative.
      However, it is targeted at generating charts for display in web browsers.
      An HTTP GET request must be sent to a Google URL.
      The URL contains request parameters that specify chart details,
      including the data to be charted.
      The "Developer Guide" is
      <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/">here</a>.
      The number of supported chart types and output formats are very limited
      in comparison to JFreeChart.
      See the "Chart type" link on the Developer Guide page.
      Only PNG output is supported.
