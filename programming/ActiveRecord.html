    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      ActiveRecord is a persistence library for Ruby.
      It is closely associated with the Ruby on Rails project.
      The main features include:
      <ul>
        <li>emphasis on convention over configuration</li>
        <li>extracting as much information as possible
          from the database schema instead of
          repeating that information in code</i>
        <li>dynamic attribute-based finder methods</li>
      </ul>
      Docmentation can be found in the rdoc (Ruby's version of javadoc)
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/api/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html">here</a>.
      Support for composite primary keys is not provided out of the box,
      but is provided by a plug-in found
      <a target="_blank" href="http://compositekeys.rubyforge.org/">
      here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While ActiveRecord is a Ruby library, it can be used from Java
      though JRuby. At the present time, the Java code needed to do
      this is a bit messy. This is demonstrated later on this page.
    </p>

    <a name="Installing"/>
    <h3>Installing <a class="toplink" href="#top">top</a></h3>
    <p>
      To install ActiveRecord for use with Ruby,
      run the following from a shell prompt.
    </p>
    <pre><div class="code">gem install activerecord
gem install composite_primary_keys <i>(optional)</i></div></pre>
    <p>
      To install ActiveRecord for use with JRuby,
      run the following from a shell prompt.
    </p>
    <pre><div class="code">cd $JRUBY_HOME/bin
./gem install activerecord --no-rdoc --no-ri
./gem install ActiveRecord-JDBC --no-rdoc --no-ri
./gem install composite_primary_keys --no-rdoc --no-ri <i>(optional)</i></div></pre>
    <p>
      Finally, edit <code>
      $JRUBY_HOME/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/activerecord-{version}/lib/active_record.rb
      </code> and add "<code>jdbc</code>" to the list of
      RAILS_CONNECTION_ADAPTERS near the bottom of the file.
    </p>

    <a name="Example"/>
    <h3>Example <a class="toplink" href="#top">top</a></h3>
    <p>
      In this example, we'll run a few queries against a simple database.
      The database is named "music".
      It has two tables.
      The "artists" table has the columns "id" and "name".
      The "recordings" table has the columns
      "id", "name", "year" and "artist_id".
      The id columns are the primary keys of their tables.
      ActiveRecord prefers this convention,
      but it can be overridden if desired.
      The recordings table artist_id column is a foreign key reference
      to the artists table id column.
      SQL for creating the database is in the following file
      named "createTables.sql".
    </p>
    <pre><div class="code">drop database if exists music;
create database music;
use music;

drop table if exists artists;
create table artists (
  id int not null auto_increment,
  name text,
  primary key (id)
);

drop table if exists recordings;
create table recordings (
  id int not null auto_increment,
  name text,
  year int,
  artist_id int,
  primary key (id)
);</div></pre>
    <p>
      When using MySQL, this can be run with a command like the following.
    </p>
    <pre><div class="code">mysql -uroot < createTables.sql</div></pre>
    
    <p>
      The next step is to describe the objects that will be used to
      "model" database table rows.  Since the code that uses these
      definitions will also need to connect to the database,
      we'll put the code to do that in the same file.
      The following file is named "models.rb".
    </p>
    <pre><div class="code">require "rubygems"
require "active_record"

ActiveRecord::Base::establish_connection(
  :adapter=>"mysql",
  :host=>"localhost",
  :database=>"music",
  :user=>"root",
  :password=>"")

class Artist &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :recording

  # Sort based on artist name.
  def <=>(other)
    name <=> other.name
  end
end

class Recording &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :artist

  # Sort based on recording name.
  def <=>(other)
    name <=> other.name
  end
end</div></pre>

    <p>
      Now we need to put some data in the database.
      The following Ruby code demonstrates how to do this.
      The methods <code>get_artist</code> and <code>add_recording</code>
      are used to simplify the process.
    </p>
    <pre><div class="code">require "models"

$artists = {} # a global Hash

def get_artist(name)
  a = $artists[name]

  # If it hasn't been created yet, create it.
  unless a
    a = Artist.new
    a.name = name
    a.save
    $artists[name] = a
  end

  a
end

def add_recording(artist_name, recording_name, recording_year)
  r = Recording.new
  r.artist = get_artist(artist_name)
  r.name = recording_name
  r.year = recording_year
  r.save
end

name = "Deathcab For Cutie"
add_recording name, "We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes", 2000
add_recording name, "The Photo Album", 2001
add_recording name, "You Can Play These Songs With Chords", 2002
add_recording name, "Transatlanticism", 2003
add_recording name, "Plans", 2005

name = "Regina Spektor"
add_recording name, "Begin To Hope", 2006
add_recording name, "Soviet Kitch", 2003</div></pre>
    <p>
      Run this code with the following command.
    </p>
    <pre><div class="code">ruby load.rb</div></pre>

    <p>
      We're ready to write queries now.
      The following Ruby code, in a file named "query.rb",
      demonstrates a few queries.
      Examples using <code>find_by_sql</code> are commented out
      and are immediately followed by equivalent queries.
    </p>
    <pre><div class="code">require "models"

puts "Artist with id=2"
puts "  " + Artist.find(2).name

puts "\nAll artists"
# Artist.find_by_sql("select * from artists").sort.each do |a|
Artist.find(:all).sort.each do |a|
  puts "  #{a.name}"
end

puts "\n2003 Recordings"
# sql = "select * from recordings where year=2003"
# Recording.find_by_sql(sql).sort.each do |r|
Recording.find_all_by_year(2003).sort.each do |r|
  puts "  #{r.name} by #{r.artist.name}"
end</div></pre>

    <p>
      Run this code with the following command.
    </p>
    <pre><div class="code">ruby query.rb</div></pre>

    <p>
      The output from this code follows.
    </p>
    <pre><div class="code">Artist with id=2
  Regina Spektor

All artists
  Deathcab For Cutie
  Regina Spektor

2003 Recordings
  Soviet Kitch by Regina Spektor
  Transatlanticism by Deathcab For Cutie</div></pre>

    <p>
      Comparing the ActiveRecord approach to any other persistence API,
      this approach is MUCH simpler!
    </p>

    <a name="FromJava"/>
    <h3>From Java <a class="toplink" href="#top">top</a></h3>
    <p>
      ActiveRecord can be used from Java through JRuby.
      Under Java 5 and earlier, Java uses the Bean Scripting Framework
      (BSF) to access scripting languages like JRuby.
      Under Java 6 and later, Java uses the JSR 223 Scripting API.
      We'll focus on BSF here. 
      The classes <a href="ActiveRecord/BSFHelper.java.html"><code>BSFHelper</code></a>
      and <a href="ActiveRecord/JRubyHelper.java.html"><code>JRubyHelper</code></a>
      were written to make this easier.
      Here's the code in Query.java.
    </p>
    <pre><div class="code">package com.ociweb.activerecord;

import com.ociweb.bsf.BSFHelper;
import com.ociweb.jruby.JRubyHelper;
import java.util.*;
import org.apache.bsf.BSFException;
import org.jruby.*;

public class Query {

  private BSFHelper bsf = new BSFHelper();
  private JRubyHelper helper = new JRubyHelper();

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    new Query();
  }

  private Query() throws BSFException, java.io.IOException {
    System.out.println("\n2003 Recordings");

    // Make a Java List available to JRuby code
    // so it can be populated with the results.
    List recordings = new ArrayList();
    bsf.declareBean("recordings", recordings);

    // Executed JRuby code in a separate file.
    bsf.evalFile("2003recordings.jrb");

    // Retreive data that Ruby populated into the recordings List.
    Iterator iter = recordings.iterator();
    while (iter.hasNext()) {
      RubyObject recording = (RubyObject) iter.next();
      String recordingName =
        (String) helper.getAttribute(recording, "name");

      // Get the Artist object associated with this Recording object.
      // TODO: What is the intermediate object here?
      RubyObject artist = helper.callMethod(recording, "artist");
      artist = (RubyObject) artist.getInstanceVariable("@target");
      String artistName = (String) helper.getAttribute(artist, "name");

      System.out.println("  " + recordingName + " by " + artistName);
    }
  }
}</div></pre>

    <p>
      Here's the JRuby code in 2003recordings.jrb.
    </p>
    <pre><div class="code">require "models"

# $recordings is a Java ArrayList that is created in Query.java
# and declared as a BSF bean.
# This code populates it with Ruby Recoding objects.
Recording.find_all_by_year(2003).sort.each do |r|
  $recordings << r
end</div></pre>

    <p>
      To compile and run this code, the following JARs must be
      in the classpath.
      <ul>
        <li>bsf.jar - in JRuby lib directory</li>
        <li>jruby.jar - in JRuby lib directory</li>
        <li>jvyaml.jar - in JRuby lib directory</li>
        <li>commons-logging-1.1.jar - from Jakarta Commons</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      To run this code, the following system properties must be set.
      When using Ant, these can be set with nested child elements
      of the <code>java</code> task that have the form
      <code>&lt;sysproperty key="{name}" value="{value}"/></code>.
      <ul>
        <li>jruby.base - set to value of $JRUBY_HOME</li>
        <li>jruby.home - set to value of $JRUBY_HOME</li>
        <li>jruby.lib - set to value of $JRUBY_HOME/lib</li>
        <li>jruby.script - set to "jruby"</li>
        <li>jruby.shell - set to "/bin/sh"</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The output from this code follows.
    </p>
    <pre><div class="code">2003 Recordings
