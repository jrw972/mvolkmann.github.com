    <h2>Objective-C</h2>
    
    <h3>Things I Hate</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>having a .h and .m file for each class violates DRY</li>
      <li>allows all C syntax including pointer arithmetic</li>
      <li>asterisk required in declaration of all object variables,
        but -&gt; is not used to access their methods</li>
      <li>literal string syntax @"text"</li>
      <li>@property and @synthesize should be combined</li>
      <li>no automatic garbage collection under iOS</li>
      <li>very verbose methods in provided classes
        like <code>NSString</code></li>
      <li>instance variables are defined in interfaces, not classes</li>
      <li>syntax difference between using categories and protocols
        is arbitrary and not easy to remember;
        &lt;<i>protocol</i>&gt; vs. (<i>category</i>)</li>
      <li>method parameter and return types inside parens</li>
      <li>method type designator conflicts with UML syntax;
        + means class method, not public;
        - means instance method, not private</li>
      <li>the word "mutable" is used incorrectly in collection class names;
        means size can change;
        not being mutable means size is fixed;
        data can change regardless</li>
      <li>categories seem like they should be used to
        add a set of methods to multiple classes,
        but it appears they are usually used to
        add methods to a single class</li>
      <li>standard categories are needed for builtin classes like NSString
        to provide less verbose methods; it seems many people roll their own</li>
      <li>the syntax for "block closures" is so ugly that Objective-C
        may as well not have closures at all</li>
      <li>must import .h files into corresponding .m files</li>
      <li>boolean values are <code>YES</code> and <code>NO</code>,
        not <code>true</code> and <code>false</code></li>
      <li>no support for namespaces or packages so
        class naming conventions are used instead</li>
      <li>can't use [ ] syntax for all calls; some require C syntax
        so code will contain a mixture of calling syntaxes</li>
      <li>when a method calls another method in the same class,
        that method definition must appear earlier in the source file
        or warnings will appear (but it will still work)</li>
      <li>no simple way to concatenate strings</li>
      <li>no support for generics</li>
      <li>no private methods</li>
      <li>implementing mutually referential classes requires tricks</li>
    </ol>
