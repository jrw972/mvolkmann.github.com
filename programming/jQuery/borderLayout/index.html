      No one knew how Mr. Sticky got in the fish tank.
      "He's very small," Mum said as she peered at the tiny water snail.
      "Just a black dot."
      "He'll grow," said Abby and pulled her pyjama bottoms up again
      before she got into bed. They were always falling down.

      In the morning Abby jumped out of bed and switched on the light in her
      fish tank.  Gerry, the fat orange goldfish, was dozing inside the stone
      archway.  Jaws was already awake, swimming along the front of the tank
      with his white tail floating and twitching.  It took Abby a while to find
      Mr. Sticky because he was clinging to the glass near the bottom,
      right next to the gravel.

      That night Abby turned on the light to find Mr. Sticky clinging to the
      very tiniest, waviest tip of the pond weed.  It was near the water filter
      so he was bobbing about in the air bubbles.

      At school that day she wrote about the mysterious Mr. Sticky who was so
      small you could mistake him for a piece of gravel.  Some of the girls in
      her class said he seemed an ideal pet for her and kept giggling about it.

      "That looks fun," Abby said. She tried to imagine what it must be like to
      have to hang on to things all day and decided it was probably very tiring.
      She fed the fish then lay on her bed and watched them chase each other
      round and round the archway.  When they stopped Gerry began nibbling at the
      pond weed with his big pouty lips.  He sucked Mr. Sticky into his mouth
      then blew him back out again in a stream of water.  The snail floated down
      to the bottom of the tank among the coloured gravel.
